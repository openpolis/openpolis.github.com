A post_ on `Oreilly Radar`_ informs us that Github_ is trending as the social-repository of choice for governments and public institutions
who want to publish data, standards and source code.

Some remarkable examples:

* US - https://github.com/WhiteHouse
* NASA - https://github.com/nasa
* UK - https://github.com/alphagov
* Canada - https://github.com/pwgsc
* Finlandia - https://github.com/avoinministerio
* Buenos Aires - https://github.com/gcba

Github also destined an evangelist to the task.
The objective: change the way governments actually face (and solve) ICT problems, studying similar solutions in the social repository, 
and implementing from scratch only when really required.
